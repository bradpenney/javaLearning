Organizing source code is a critical part of any programming language. Java makes it relatively straightforward to organize source code into packages(classes which have a direct relationship to one another). It should be noted that in order to compile and/or run packages via the console (my preferred method), you must be in the directory above the directory in which the packages are stored. For the accompanying example, to compile the code enter (must be in the folder above the bookpack folder):

  <code>javac bookpack/BookDemo.java</code>

In order to run the program, the following command must be entered in the folder above the bookpack folder:

  <code>java bookpack.BookDemo</code>
